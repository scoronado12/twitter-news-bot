# twitterbot

This is my Twitter Bot, as of now it is supposed to simply connect to a twitter account and respond "pong" when you tweet "ping".

# Usage

Create a file, apikeys.txt and fill in the Twitter API Keys in this order. If you fork, make sure you do not accidentally upload that to a public repository.

# Testing 


You can test this bot for now by Tweeting "ping" to @NenoSong, it should respond "pong"

@NenoSong will respond with the name of the song that you have tweeted to it.

If it does not respond, then @BotNeno may have been ratelimited or I don't have script running.
    
# Depends
